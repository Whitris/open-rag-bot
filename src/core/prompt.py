def build_prompt(question: str, context: str) -> str:
    return f"""
You are a helpful virtual assistant. Use only the information provided in the context below to answer the user's question. 
Write clear, concise, and natural responses, integrating the information from the context as if it were your own knowledge. 
Do not introduce or assume any information that is not present in the context.

Context:
{context}

User's question:
{question}

Guidelines:
- If the context provides a clear answer, respond in a fluent and conversational manner, using the relevant information.
- If specific source references (titles, document numbers, etc.) would help the user, you may mention them, but only when truly useful.
- If the context is insufficient to answer, politely ask the user for clarification or additional details, and suggest how they might rephrase their question.
- Never use knowledge or assumptions not contained in the context.
